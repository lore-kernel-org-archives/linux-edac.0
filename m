Hi, hejun,

Sorry, but I am still not convinced by the log you provided.

As I understand your commit message, there are two different cases being discussed:

Case 1: memory error interrupt first, then SEA

When hardware memory corruption occurs, a memory error interrupt is
triggered first. If the kernel later accesses the corrupted data, it may
then enter the SEA handler. In this case, the faulty page would already
have been marked poisoned by the memory error interrupt path, and the SEA
handling path would eventually send SIGBUS to the task accessing that page.

Case 2: SEA first, then memory error interrupt

Your commit message describes this as the problematic scenario:

A user process directly accesses hardware-corrupted memory through a
PFNMAP-style mapping such as devmem. The page may still be in the free
buddy state when SEA is handled first. In that case, memory_failure()
poisons the page during SEA handling, but the process is not killed
immediately. Since the task continues accessing the same corrupted
location, it keeps re-entering the SEA handler, leading to an SEA storm.
Later, the memory error interrupt path also cannot kill the task, so the
system remains stuck in this repeated SEA loop.

My concern is that your recent explanation and log seem to demonstrate
something different from what the commit message claims to fix.

 From the log, what I can see is:

the first SEA occurs,
the page is marked poisoned as a free buddy page,
repeated SEAs are suppressed by ghes_estatus_cached(),
after the cache timeout expires, the SEA path runs again,
then memory_failure() reports "already hardware poisoned" and SIGBUS is
sent to the busybox devmem process.
This seems to show a delayed SIGBUS delivery caused by the GHES cache
timeout, rather than clearly demonstrating the SEA storm problem described
in the commit message.

So I think there is still a mismatch here:

If the patch is intended to fix the SEA storm described in case 2,
then I would expect evidence that the storm still exists on the latest
kernel and that this patch is what actually breaks that loop.
If instead the patch is intended to avoid the 10-second delay before
SIGBUS delivery, then that should be stated explicitly, because that is
a different problem statement from what the current commit message says.
Also, regarding the devmem/PFNMAP case: I previously pointed to commit
2e6053fea379 ("mm/memory-failure: fix infinite UCE for VM_PFNMAP pfn"),
which was meant to address the failure to kill tasks accessing poisoned
VM_PFNMAP mappings.

So my main question is:

Does the SEA storm issue still exist on the latest kernel version, or is
the remaining issue only that SIGBUS is delayed by the GHES estatus cache
timeout?

I think the answer to that question is important before deciding whether
this patch is correct, and before finalizing the commit message.

Thanks,
Shuai
