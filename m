More open questions:

And do you know of actual real-life examples where this is really the
case? Do you have any users who report a large error count on ARM CPUs,
originating from the caches and that something like that would really
help?

Because from my x86 CPUs limited experience, the cache arrays are mostly
fine and errors reported there are not something that happens very
frequently so we don't even need to collect and count those.

So is this something which you need to have in order to check a box
somewhere that there is some functionality or is there an actual
real-life use case behind it which a customer has requested?

Open question from James with my reply to it:

You mean rasdaemon goes and offlines CPUs when certain thresholds are
reached? Sure. It would be much more flexible too.

First we answer questions and discuss, then we code.
