I'll probably refine it a bit before merging, but I don't think it is
a hack.  It reflects the behaviour that makes sense when registering
devices hanging off the root node.  If a device node is a child of the
root, then we know it isn't hanging off an i2c or pci bus, or anything
else.  It is essentially a system device.

The troublesome bit is that the root node also has memory, cpus,
chosen and aliases nodes which are not devices.  In the vast majority
of cases, we want all the device nodes that are children of the root
to be registered, but we don't want to register the special nodes.
Checking for the presence of a compatible property is a pretty good
test for determining whether or not a node actually represents a
device, especially because all users of of_platform_bus_probe() seem
to be FDT users where we've been very strict about enforcing that
drivers must use the compatible property for matching to device nodes.

Cheers,
