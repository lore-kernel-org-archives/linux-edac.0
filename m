Sorry for the mistake in the commit message. The function arm64_do_kernel_sea() should
be arm64_notify_die().

If apei_claim_sea() returns an error, arm64_notify_die() will call arm64_force_sig_fault(inf->sig /* SIGBUS */, , , ),
followed by force_sig_fault(SIGBUS, , ) to force the process to receive the SIGBUS signal.

I retested this issue on the kernel v7.0.0-rc4 with the following debug patch and was still able to reproduce it.
