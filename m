Yes. The devmem process is expected to terminate upon receiving a SIGBUS signal, you can
see this at the last line of the test log after the patch is applied.
For other processes whether it terminates depends on whether it catches the signal; the kernel is
responsible for sending it immediately.

I just removed some duplicate debug logs: "This error has already been...", these were added by myself.
> The error log also indicates that the SIGBUS is delivered as expected.

An SError occurs at kernel time 130.558038. Then, after 10 seconds, the kernel
can re-enter the SEA processing flow and send the SIGBUS signal to the process.
This 10-second delay corresponds to the cache timeout threshold of the
ghes_estatus_cached() feature.
Therefore, the purpose of this patch is to send the SIGBUS signal to the process
immediately, rather than waiting for the timeout to expire.
